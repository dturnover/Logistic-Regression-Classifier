# LogisticRegressionClassifier
Logistic regression classifier coded from scratch.

The data is found in the main (logisticRegression()) function. I have a demo built in but you can replace it with a dataset of your choosing.
For any number of training examples not equal to two turn the global variable "Visualize" off
